This area survived the 1755 earthquake and offers a glimpse into medieval Lisbon.\n    *   Visit the **Lisbon Cathedral (Sé de Lisboa)**, a majestic Romanesque cathedral with a rich history.\n    *   Wander up to the **Miradouro das Portas do Sol** and **Miradouro de Santa Luzia** for breathtaking views over Alfama and the Tagus River.\n*   **Lunch (1:00 PM - 2:30 PM): Traditional Portuguese Lunch in Alfama**\n    *   Enjoy a traditional Portuguese lunch at a local tasca (tavern) in Alfama. Look for places serving \"Bacalhau à Brás\" (codfish with scrambled eggs and potatoes) or \"Sardinhas Assadas\" (grilled sardines, especially if you're there in summer).\n*   **Afternoon (2:30 PM - 6:00 PM): Baixa District & Rossio Square**\n    *   Head down to the Baixa district, rebuilt after the 1755 earthquake with a grid-like street plan.\n    *   Walk along **Rua Augusta**, a pedestrian street leading to the impressive **Arco da Rua Augusta** and **Praça do Comércio** (Commerce Square).\n    *   Explore **Rossio Square (Praça de D. Pedro IV)**, a lively hub in the city center with a distinctive wave-patterned pavement.\n*   **Evening (7:30 PM onwards): Dinner & Fado in Alfama**\n    *   Return to Alfama for a memorable dinner experience. Many restaurants in this area offer live **Fado music**, a soulful Portuguese musical genre, while you dine.\n\nHow does this sound for your first day? We can adjust anything you like!"
